# arith
The code contains an interpreter for the language arith coded in Python version 3.6. The algorithm is split into a Lexer, a Parser and an Evaluator. The lexer divides the input expression(type string) into Tokens. The Parser then takes these tokens and converts them into an Abstract Syntax Tree, a binary tree which maintains the precedence of operations. The Evaluator then traverses this tree and computes the result.

## How to Run 
make
./arith
